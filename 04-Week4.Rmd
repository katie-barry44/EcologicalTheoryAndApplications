# Week 4 {#week4}

In week 4 of the course, we are taking our populations and putting them in space by creating metapopulations!  

This week's checklist is: 
[  ] R Markdown assignment #5 - Day10-ConnectingPopulations.Rmd   
[  ] Word document for each group describing your hypothesis, method for testing your hypothesis, and statistical design for the Oostvaardersplassen grazing question   

This week can be very clearly structured into three sections: 
1. **Theory** - where we discuss the theory of meta-populations and try to connect the course.   
2. **Application** - Discussing how meta-population theory applies to management of large animal populations.   
3. **Synthesis** - You take what we've discussed and turn it into an idea for a project.   

## Day 10 - 16.5.2022 - Theory

The theory lecture can be found here but will also be given live on Monday!   

You can also find the explanation for this week's modeling components here.  

Complete the modeling assignment on meta-populations which you can find on the Blackboard, in Teams, or in your email! It should be turned in via Teams.   

## Day 11 - 18.5.2022 - Application

The lecture on application can be found here but will also be given live on Wednesday!   

You can find the additional literature that you can use to support your hypotheses in the Teams Files folder or on the Blackboard.   

**Optional Field Trip** 

If you would like to join Katie for the optional field trip at the Oostvaardersplassen -   
- 14:00 in front of the Natuurbelegincentrum De Oostvaarders   

**Your assignment** 

1. Develop a hypothesis for what is causing plant species decline in the Oostvaardersplassen   
2. Develop a method for testing this hypothesis   
3. Develop a statistical test for testing this hypothesis   

Your explanation should include: 
 - How meta-population dynamics contribute to the different effects of our grazer populations at the Oostvaardersplassen 
 - At least, one of the three theoretical components weâ€™ve discussed:   
  - Competition   
  - Facilitation   
  - Abiotic conditions  

## Day 12 - 20.5.2022 - Synthesis 

Work in your groups to complete the assignment. Please submit a word document describing and justifying your hypothesis, method, and statistical test.
