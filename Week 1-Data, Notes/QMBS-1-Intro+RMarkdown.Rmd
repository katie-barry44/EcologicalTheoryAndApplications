**LEARNING GOAL** Our goal for this morning is to get you oriented and comfortable with R and how using the tutorials will work. 

##Part 1: Some notes on the tutorials included in this course. 

1. R code is  always presented as a gray box like this one:  
```{r codeinthewild}
# A chunk of code 
a<-1
print(a)
```

2. Anything in a chunk of code that appears with a # before it is a "comment". R doesn't see these as code.   

```{r comments}
#This is a comment, R doesn't see this as code 
#1+2 
1+2 
```

3. The help function is your best friend! If you type in a "?" before the name of a function in R then the help documentation on that function will come up. This help documentation always has information on the usage, the arguments that the function can take, and some reproducible examples.   

```{r thehelpfunction}
?help()
#This shows you the help documentation for the "help" function 
```

4. When you are using R in R studio, R saves your objects in the "global environment".

Sometimes you need to clear this out. The command rm(list=ls()) clears everything out of your global environment. Or you can use the little broom icon! 

```{r clearingyourglobalenvironment}
rm(list=ls())
```


```{r}
dragon.height<-read.csv("./data/DragonHeight.csv")

help(read.csv)

?read.csv()

```
