**LEARNING GOALS** Today we have two goals:
1. Understand how connectedness can change the dynamics of a population 
2. Develop hypotheses for populations that are connected vs. unconnected

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(primer)
```

### Part 1: Review 

Let's think back to the beginning of the course where we focused on a single population of individuals. We used the function clogistic() to model single species population dynamics. 

This function had two parameters: 
r - the rate of population increase or birth rate 
alpha - the self limitation coefficient or intraspecific competition coefficient 

```{r reviewing single population growth}
y0<-c(1)

#the time points that the model will run for
t<-0:100

#setting the parameters
p<-c(r=0.1, alpha=0.2)

#note that I have changed the func to "lvcomp2" this is the function for competition in this package
out <- ode(y=y0, times=t, func=clogistic, parms=p)

plot(out)
```

This function models our population in isolation. Individuals are being born but no additional are coming in via other methods and no individuals are leaving. This model thinks of a population as an isolated group of individuals. 

### Part 2: Introducing the meta-population 

Outside - groups of species are connected to each other. 

For example:
