**LEARNING GOALS** We have three major learning goals for today: 
1. Get used to working with R Markdown for the assignments in the course. 2. Get used to working with data in R 
3. Create your first ecological model in R

##Part 1: Some notes on the tutorials included in this course. 

1. R code is  always presented as a gray box like this one:  

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Part 2: Dealing with data in R
